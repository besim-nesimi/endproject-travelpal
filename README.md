# endproject-travelpal
School project, CRUD application made with WPF for .NET
TravelPal is an imaginary startup company that wants an app made for them which will allow users to create, read, update and delete information regarding travels.
The C is registering new users, adding new travels and such.
The R lets users (and admins) see their (admins sees all) travels in a listview and also see travel details.
The U lets users update username, password and country of origin (personal details/user details).
The D lets users delete their own travels, while Admins get to delete all travels made by all users.
This project is the first(!) major CRUD application made with WPF for .NET after learning all the basics of C# and WPF.
